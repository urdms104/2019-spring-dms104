# Assignment 2: Research Plan

***Due: Thursday, February 21, 2018 (before 12:30 PM)***<br>

This assignment is a "checkpoint" to make sure you're on the right track for new, important things coming up in DMS 104.  This is a graded, team assignment.  Although there are a lot of requirements, it can be done relatively quickly if you divide-up the work among your team.  (Suggestions in the instructions below.)

Also keep in mind, this is a "checkpoint" assignment meaning this assignment doesn't carry a lot of weight in your overall grade for DMS 104, i.e. don't stress it *too* much, however it's important to do this assignment  well so the professor can provide feedback to make sure you're on the right track when it matters.

We will discuss whatever you write in an open discussion on Thursday, February 21.

Note: this assignment is just the plan to do the research work.  You do not actually do the work yet.

## Assignment 

Get your team together.  Create a document that details a *research plan* that your city-team will use to gather information that will support the design of your product.

Typically, your **Team Lead** will work with their team to divvy up the responsibilities for writing this assignment among the team members.  

- The timeliness, formatting, completeness of the submission will reflect upon the Team Lead's grade.
- Everyone else will be graded equally based on the quality of the information in the document unless a team member falls short of expectations.  (Anyone should DM me in Slack as soon as you realize there may be an issue. Don't wait until Thursday morning ...that'll be too late.)

### Formatting

The document needs to be formatted with the typical college stuff:

- **Cover information**: assignment name, date, your team name and the name and role of each person on your team
- **Text**: segment the information using meaningful headers.  Write the information using paragraphs, lists, whatever you need to communicate clearly.  And for god's sake, spell check!
- **Colophon**: on the last page, list who did what (i.e. who wrote what part) in support of the creation of this document.

### Content of the Document

*Remember that DMS 104 is a "flipped" course, meaning you're expected to learn certain things outside the classroom time so we can concentrate on workshops and discussions when we get together in Rettner Hall.  So at this point, you're expected to have been studying Chapters 6, 7, and 9 in the book.*  

*Note: with this assignment, this is where the professor can really tell if you've been studying from the book or just BS'ng in the workshops.  The requirements described below refer to very specific things that come right out of the book!  If you're confused about some of the terminology or things you're expected to do, then: you need to refer to the book!*

In the document, report:

- Regarding the **interviews** that you will need to do over the next few weeks in DMS 104: 
  - What are the **user roles** you've identified for your product; explain anything that needs to be explained about each role.  Who does what and why?  What are their **data needs** and **relationships** to each other?
  - In a perfect world (i.e. not college) **how many of each role *should be* interviewed**?  Also answer for each role: do you need to scale-up because it's a broad role?  Or scale-down because of other factors?  Explain.
  - Also report: **what roles *will you actually* interview** as part of your DMS 104 design project?  (Also, make sure you can reasonably find these people when you try to setup the interviews.)  What roles are you conscientiously deciding to not interview, and why?
  - **THE MOST IMPORTANT PART:** for each designer-role (IxD, VisD, and ID): what specific pieces of information do you need to get out of the interviews?  (Think in terms of your role in the design team.)  And as you answer that, what types of questions do you plan to ask to get that information? 
    - Suggestion: each team member write their own section in the document for this part
    - Note: this requirement (above) might not make sense at first.  You really have to think about your own role and your focus in the design process: visual, interactive, or industrial.  
    - Everyone *can* answer this question and write about it!  The professor would not have approved your design idea if he didn't think it could be done.

- Regarding all **other forms of research**:
  - Besides user interviews (which will be mandatory) and focus groups and stakeholder interviews (which we've already done) what other type(s) of research makes sense for your product, and why?
    - Later, when you actually preform more research you will need to pick *at least* one other research type that you team decided to do. (And of course, you can do more than one other type!)
  - Based on the other research you plan to do, explain any considerations you need to take into account.  Dependencies to be able to do the research?  Concerns?  Will you need help?  Money?  Explain.
  - Depending on what other research you plan to do, provide a simple plan (explanation) about how and when you plan to do it.  (For real!)

  ## Turn it in

  Although there is no length requirement to this assignment, you'll probably end-up with about two pages of text - maybe more, maybe less.  It doesn't matter so long as all the requirements of the document are fulfilled.

  Note: you can (probably) use a Google Doc to construct your document, but the professor needs a snapshot of your document - *not* your Google Doc, because it can be updated while he's trying to grade it!  So please export whatever you use to: **Microsoft Word** and turn *that* in on Blackboard.

  Submit your team's document in our DMS 104 section in Blackboard, in the Assignments area: **Assignment 2: Research Plan**
